How the web works:

User -> Browser -> Website 
 //enters url   //expects to see

What we don't see is the server that the website is stored and generated on.
A user first enters a URL into the browser
Server's have IP addresses
    you could actually enter the IP address and get to the website
Each domain name is mapped to an IP Address.
The DNS Server translates domains, and gets you to the server
The response we see is the HTML, CSS and Javascript

HTML dictates structure (headings, body, etc)
CSS (Cascading style Sheets) dictates how things look
Javascript dictates how things interact- the dynamic things that happen like dropdowns and buttons
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) makes sure the data is encrypted. 

Backend happens at the server, frontend is going on where we see the website interface
